  Error Number : When there has been an Error in the processing of the Instruction Packet.

  0x01	Result Fail	Failed to process the sent Instruction Packet
  0x02	Instruction Error	Undefined Instruction has been used
  Action has been used without Reg Write
  0x03	CRC Error	CRC of the sent Packet does not match
  0x04	Data Range Error	Data to be written in the corresponding Address is outside the range of the minimum/maximum value
  0x05	Data Length Error	Attempt to write Data that is shorter than the data length of the corresponding Address
  (ex: when you attempt to only use 2 bytes of a item that has been defined as 4 bytes)
  0x06	Data Limit Error	Data to be written in the corresponding Address is outside of the Limit value
  0x07	Access Errer	Attempt to write a value in an Address that is Read Only or has not been defined
  Attempt to read a value in an Address that is Write Only or has not been defined
  Attempt to write a value in the ROM domain while in a state of Torque Enable(ROM Lock)

Value Instructions  Description
0x01  Ping  Instruction that checks whether the Packet has arrived to a device with the same ID as Packet ID
0x02  Read  Instruction to read data from the Device
0x03  Write Instruction to write data on the Device
0x04  Reg Write Instruction that registers the Instruction Packet to a standby status; Packet is later executed through the Action command
0x05  Action  Instruction that executes the Packet that was registered beforehand using Reg Write
0x06  Factory Reset Instruction that resets the Control Table to its initial factory default settings
0x08  Reboot  Instruction to reboot the Device
0x10  Clear Instruction to reset certain information
0x55  Status(Return)  Return Instruction for the Instruction Packet
0x82  Sync Read For multiple devices, Instruction to read data from the same Address with the same length at once
0x83  Sync Write  For multiple devices, Instruction to write data on the same Address with the same length at once
0x92  Bulk Read For multiple devices, Instruction to read data from different Addresses with different lengths at once
0x93  Bulk Write  For multiple devices, Instruction to write data on different Addresses with different lengths at once
